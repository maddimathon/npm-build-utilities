<!-- #region MultiFormatArgs -->
Pass multiple format overrides as an object.

If this is passed as the args param (tested for via the presence of a `_` object
property), the `_` property is considered universal and the remaining formats
are applied after merging (recursively) with the value of `_`.

<!-- #region MinifyArgsProp -->
This is a placeholder type for when minifying is implemented in the future. It 
is a very loose version of (the relevant property in) 
[minify.Options](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3ADefinitelyTyped%2FDefinitelyTyped+path%3A%2F%5Etypes%5C%2Fminify%5C%2F%2F+symbol%3AOptions&type=code).
